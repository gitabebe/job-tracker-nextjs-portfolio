## ✨ Key Features & Technical Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases the ability to build, manage, and deploy a professional-grade single-page application.

* **Next.js (App Router):** The application is structured using Next.js for routing and superior performance, ensuring fast load times and an excellent developer experience.
* **Tailwind CSS Mastery:** The entire UI is built using the Tailwind CSS utility framework, demonstrating proficiency in rapid styling, responsive design, and professional UI/UX best practices (clean forms, table styling, and clear visual hierarchy).
* **Full Responsiveness:** The dashboard implements a mobile-first design:
    * **Desktop:** Uses a **1/3 Grid Layout** (Form in sidebar, Table in main content).
    * **Mobile:** The Form and Table stack vertically for usability on smaller screens.
* **Component Architecture (React):** Uses reusable React components (`JobForm`, `JobTable`) with clear data flow, proving competence in managing state and application structure.
* **Dynamic Data Handling:** Uses React hooks (`useState`) to manage the list of applications, including:
    * Form input and submission handling.
    * Real-time data filtering by **Application Status**.
    * Conditional styling (color-coded status badges).
* **Professional Deployment:** Deployed via **Vercel**, proving the ability to handle modern CI/CD pipelines and production hosting.
